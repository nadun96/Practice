### **Day 1: Basics of Data Structures and Complexity Analysis**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Introduction to Data Structures.
- Big-O Notation:
  - Time Complexity (O(1), O(n), O(n²)).
  - Space Complexity.
- Arrays:
  - Static arrays in Java.
  - Basic operations: insertion, deletion, traversal.

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a Java program to:
   - Implement basic operations on an array (e.g., adding/removing elements).
   - Find the largest and smallest elements in an array.
2. Analyze the time complexity of your implementations.

**Resources:**

  - String manipulation in Java (`StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer`).
- Recursion:
  - Concept and use cases.
  - Writing recursive functions.
  - Solving problems with recursion.

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a Java program to:
   - Reverse a string without using built-in functions.

**Topics to Cover:**

- Stacks:
  - Operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`.
  - Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- Queues:
  - Operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`.
  - Types: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue.
- Applications:
  - Balancing parentheses, undo operations in text editors.

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a Java program to:
   - Implement a stack and queue.
   - Check for balanced parentheses using a stack.
