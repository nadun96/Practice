### **7-Day JavaScript Advanced Concepts Learning Plan (1 Hour Daily)**

This plan focuses on advanced JavaScript topics while maintaining a practical, hands-on approach. Each day includes theory, practical tasks, and key advanced topics.

---

### **Day 1: Advanced Functions**

**Topics to Cover:**

- **Function Closures**:
  - Understand lexical scoping and closures.
- **Higher-Order Functions**:
  - Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return functions.
- **Callback Functions**:
  - Using callbacks in asynchronous operations.
- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)**.

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a closure to create a private counter (increment, reset).
2. Implement a higher-order function for filtering numbers from an array.
3. Write an IIFE to log a welcome message.

**Resources:**

- [MDN: Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

### **Day 2: Advanced Objects**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Object Methods:
  - `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`.
- Prototypes and Inheritance:
  - Prototype chaining and `Object.create()`.
- `this` keyword:
  - How `this` works in different contexts (global, object, function, arrow function).
- Object Destructuring and Spread/Rest Operators.

**Practical Task:**

1. Create an object representing a user and manipulate its properties using `Object.keys()` and `Object.values()`.
2. Create a prototype chain for an object.
3. Use destructuring to extract specific properties from an object.

**Resources:**

- [MDN: Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)

### **Day 3: Asynchronous JavaScript**

**Topics to Cover:**

- The Event Loop and Call Stack.
- Promises:
  - Chaining with `.then()`, `.catch()`.
- Async/Await:
  - Writing asynchronous code in a cleaner way.
- Fetch API:
  - Making HTTP requests and handling responses.

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a promise that resolves or rejects based on a condition.
2. Use `async/await` to fetch and display data from a public API.
3. Visualize the Event Loop with a simple `setTimeout()` example.

**Resources:**

- [MDN: Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
- [Event Loop Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

### **Day 4: ES6+ and Advanced Syntax**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Modules:
  - `import` and `export` syntax.
- Default and Named Exports.
- Dynamic Imports.
- JavaScript Iterators and Generators.
- Symbol and `for...of`.

**Practical Task:**

1. Create and use a module system with `import/export`.
2. Write a generator function to yield Fibonacci numbers.
3. Use `for...of` to iterate through an iterable (array, map).

**Resources:**

- [MDN: Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

### **Day 5: Error Handling and Debugging**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Try-Catch Blocks:
  - Handling exceptions.
- Custom Errors:
  - Creating custom error classes.
- Debugging Techniques:
  - Using browser DevTools.
- Performance Profiling:
  - Measuring code execution time.

**Practical Task:**

1. Create a function that throws an error when invalid data is passed.
2. Use `try-catch` to handle the error gracefully.
3. Use browser DevTools to debug a sample script with errors.

**Resources:**

- [MDN: Error Handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling)

### **Day 6: Advanced Data Structures**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Sets and Maps:
  - Operations and use cases.
- WeakMap and WeakSet:
  - Memory-sensitive collections.
- Working with Typed Arrays.
- Custom Iterables:
  - Creating custom data structures.

**Practical Task:**

1. Implement a Set for unique elements and perform operations like union, intersection.
2. Use a Map to store key-value pairs, then iterate through it.
3. Create a custom iterable object.

**Resources:**

- [MDN: Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
- [MDN: Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)

---

### **Day 7: JavaScript Patterns and Performance**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Design Patterns:
  - Singleton, Factory, Module, Observer Patterns.
- Functional Programming:
  - Immutability, Pure Functions, Currying.
- Memory Management:
  - Garbage Collection.
- Performance Optimization:
  - Debouncing and Throttling.
- Web Workers:
  - Running scripts in the background.

**Practical Task:**

1. Implement a Singleton pattern for an app configuration object.
2. Use debouncing to optimize a search input field.
3. Create a basic Web Worker to perform a time-intensive calculation.

**Resources:**

### **Bonus (Optional Topics)**

- **JavaScript Frameworks**: Introduction to React, Vue, or Angular.
- **Unit Testing**: Jest or Mocha for testing JavaScript code.
- **Node.js**: Learn backend development with JavaScript.
