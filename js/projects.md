### Learning Flow

1. **Start with smaller projects** that focus on basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
2. **Gradually increase complexity** by adding more features like APIs, data storage, and advanced JavaScript patterns.
3. **Incorporate frameworks** like React, Vue, or Angular once you're comfortable with JavaScript and ES6+ features.
4. **Work on backend integration** as you move into full-stack development, combining both frontend and backend technologies.
