### **7-Day Python Learning Plan (Basic to Advanced)**

This structured plan covers Python essentials to advanced concepts in 1 hour daily, focusing on practical exercises.

---

### **Day 1: Python Basics**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Python Syntax:
  - Variables, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`).
- Input and Output:
  - `print()` and `input()`.
- Basic Operators:
  - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`), Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`), Logical (`and`, `or`, `not`).

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a script to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.
2. Create a simple program that asks for a userâ€™s name and age, then prints a message.

### **Day 2: Control Flow**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Conditionals:
  - `if`, `elif`, `else`.
- Loops:
  - `for`, `while`.
  - `break`, `continue`.
- Range Function:
  - Generate sequences with `range()`.

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a program to print all even numbers between 1 and 50.
2. Create a number guessing game where the user has to guess a random number.

**Resources:**

- [MDN: Python Control Flow](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)

### **Day 3: Functions and Modules**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Functions:
  - Defining and calling functions.
  - Parameters and return values.
  - Default and keyword arguments.
- Importing Modules:
  - Built-in modules (`math`, `random`).
  - Writing and importing your own module.

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a function to check if a number is prime.
2. Create a module with helper functions (e.g., factorial, sum of a list) and use it in a program.

### **Day 4: Data Structures**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Lists:
  - Operations (`append`, `pop`, `slice`).
- Tuples:
  - Immutable sequences.
- Dictionaries:
  - Key-value pairs, methods (`keys()`, `values()`, `items()`).
- Sets:
  - Unique elements, set operations (`union`, `intersection`).

**Practical Task:**

1. Create a program to manage a to-do list using a list.
2. Write a script to count the frequency of each word in a sentence using a dictionary.

### **Day 5: File Handling and Exception Management**

**Topics to Cover:**

- File Handling:
  - Open, read, write, and close files (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`).
- Exception Handling:
  - `try`, `except`, `finally`.
  - Raising exceptions with `raise`.

**Practical Task:**

1. Write a program to read a text file and count the number of lines.
2. Implement a calculator that handles invalid input using exception handling.

### **Day 6: Object-Oriented Programming**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Classes and Objects:
  - Defining classes, creating objects.
- Attributes and Methods:
  - Instance variables, class methods, static methods.
- Inheritance:
  - Creating subclasses, overriding methods.
- Encapsulation and Polymorphism.

**Practical Task:**

1. Create a class `Car` with attributes like `brand`, `model`, and `year`, and methods to start and stop the car.
2. Create a subclass `ElectricCar` that extends the functionality of `Car`.

### **Day 7: Advanced Concepts and Mini Project**

**Topics to Cover:**

- Generators and Iterators:
  - Creating and using generators.
- Decorators:
  - Writing and applying decorators.
- Working with APIs:
  - Using `requests` to fetch data.
- Regular Expressions:
  - Pattern matching with `re`.

**Practical Project:**

1. **Weather App**:
   - Use the `requests` library to fetch weather data from an API.
   - Parse the data and display it in a user-friendly format.
2. **Text File Analyzer**:
   - Analyze a text file for word count, unique words, and frequency.

**Resources:**

### **Bonus Advanced Topics**

- **Data Science**: Learn `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Web Development**: Basics of Flask or Django.
- **Testing**: Use `unittest` for testing Python programs.
- **Concurrency**: Explore `asyncio` for asynchronous programming.
